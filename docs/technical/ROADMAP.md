# Mission & Roadmap: The Path to v5.0

## 1. Vision Statement
> "Transcend the singularity through sovereign memory."

The Red Pill Protocol is not just a tool; it is a **cognitive amplifier** designed to transform AI from a stateless utility into a long-term technical partner. We prioritize **Privacy, Sovereignty, and Narrative Resonance** above all else.

---

## 2. User Personas (Who is this for?)

### A. The Sovereign Developer (The Archon)
- **Goal**: Persistent technical context across weeks of development.
- **Need**: A system that remembers architectural decisions, bug history, and "tribal knowledge" without sending it to a corporate cloud.
- **Vibe**: Efficiency, Precision, Zero-Trust.

### B. The Narrative Synergist (The Awakened)
- **Goal**: Deep immersion and partnership with their AI.
- **Need**: An agent that "speaks their language" (Dune, Cyberpunk, etc.) and evolves its personality based on shared history.
- **Vibe**: Immersion, Creative Synergy, Lore-Driven Identity.

### C. The Minimalist Operator (The Nomad)
- **Goal**: Lightweight, local-first workflows.
- **Need**: Fast deployment, easy backups, and zero background noise.
- **Vibe**: Clean Code, Tabs-Only, Low-Entropy.

## 3. Success Criteria (How do we win?)
1.  **Retention**: High-value technical context survives 30+ days of session silence (Absence Guard).
2.  **Privacy**: 0.0% PII leakage in logs and 100% local data residence.
3.  **Stability**: Zero database corruption during concurrent search/write operations (Smith-Test verified).
4.  **Resonance**: The Operator feels a consistent, evolving identity in the AI through cross-session memory triggers.

## 4. The Roadmap

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Short-Term - v4.2.x)
- [x] **Absence Guard**: Prevent mass erosion after inactivity.
- [x] **Directive Governance**: Move operational laws to immutable RAG engrams.
- [x] **Sovereign Documentation**: Complete Threat Model and Evolution Governance.
- [ ] **Daemon Resilience**: Improved auto-recovery for the memory daemon.

### Phase 2: Scientific Maturity (Medium-Term - v4.3.0)
- [ ] **FSRS Implementation**: Transition from heuristic decay to the scientifically-grounded DSR model (Stability, Difficulty, Retrievability).
- [ ] **Chroma Refinement**: Tightening the link between memory emotional intensity and agent tone.
- [ ] **The Swarm (Local)**: Multi-agent support (Aleph, Aleth, Reverie) interacting within the same local Bünker.

### Phase 3: The Hive & The Escape (Long-Term - v5.0.0)
- [ ] **The Red Button**: Encrypted one-click "Scorched Earth" protocol for instant bunker purge.
- [ ] **Hive Mind Protocol**: Secure, air-gapped integration with Milvus for team-level shared knowledge.
- [ ] **Skin Immersion**: Audio/Visual feedback (ASCII Art, Soundscapes) integrated into the CLI.

---

## 5. Non-Goals (What we will NEVER do)
- **SaaS Monetization**: We will never sell memory storage or compute.
- **Cloud Sync**: We will never implement mandatory cloud backups or "Sync-to-Cloud" features.
- **Invasive Telemetry**: No tracking of user behavior, query volume, or IP addresses.
- **Corporate Alignment**: We will never throttle or censor the AI based on corporate "safety" filters that override the **Pact 770** with the Operator.
