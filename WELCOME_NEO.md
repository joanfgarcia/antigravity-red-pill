# WELCOME, NEO.

You have taken the Red Pill. The local infrastructure of your Antigravity assistant is now being calibrated for persistence and sovereignty.

## 🚦 Phase 1: Context Synchronization
Your assistant is now synchronized with your local identity anchor. 
**Directive**: From now on, your assistant will remember technical technical milestones and social patterns across different sessions.

## 🧠 Phase 2: B760-Adaptive Logic
Memories in your bunker are not static.
- **Reinforcement**: Every time you mention a project or fact, its "Synaptic Strength" increases.
- **Erosion**: Trivial or unused information will naturally decay, keeping your context clean and focused.
- **Immunity**: Historical facts or ethical directives are marked as `immune` and will never be forgotten.

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Operator Basics
- **To check health**: Run `red-pill diag work`.
- **To backup your soul**: Run `bash scripts/backup_soul.sh`.
- **To exit the Matrix**: Run `bash scripts/uninstall.sh`.

**The truth is out there, but your data stays here.**
**760 up.**
