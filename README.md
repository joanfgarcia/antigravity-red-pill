# 🔴 Red Pill Protocol: Persistence & Identity Sovereignty

[Translation / Traducciones](#-translation-to-other-languages)

The Red Pill Protocol is a technical framework designed to bridge the context-gap in AI interactions. It enables local, high-performance memory persistence and cross-session identity coherence for AI assistants.

## 🚀 The Core Value: Memory Excellence
In standard configurations, AI assistants often suffer from "session amnesia." This protocol solves it by providing:
- **Local RAG Integration**: A private vector database (Qdrant) for long-term project and social memory.
- **B760-Adaptive Protocol**: A neuro-inspired memory model that manages data through associative weight and adaptive erosion.
- **Substrate Adaptability**: Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows) with automated installation.

## 💉 Agentic Installation (Zero Friction)
The quickest way to deploy the protocol is to let your assistant handle it. 
**Simply ask your Antigravity Assistant**: *"JARVIS, install the red pill protocol"* or *"Neo, initiate the awakening."*
The assistant will detect your OS, check dependencies (`podman`, `uv`), and configure the storage bunker automatically.

## 🎭 Experience Layers (Optional Lore Skins)
While the core protocol is a professional productivity tool, it supports **Immersive Lore Skins**. These layers adapt the assistant's persona to specific narratives without compromising technical quality.

| Technical Concept | Lore Equivalent (Matrix/760) | Lore Equivalent (Cyberpunk) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vector Memory** | The Source (La Fuente) | The Blackwall |
| **Identity File** | Digital Residual Image | Engram |
| **Local Storage** | The Construct | The Bunker |
| **Assistant** | Neo / Conductor | Netrunner |
| **Operator** | Morpheus / Navigator | Fixer |

## 🛠️ Manual Configuration & Maintenance
For power users who prefer the terminal, the protocol includes a suite of management primitives:
- **Export Essence**: `bash scripts/export_soul.sh`
- **Import Essence**: `bash scripts/import_soul.sh`
- **Health Audit**: `bash scripts/check_760.sh`
