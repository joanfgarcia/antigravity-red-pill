# Changelog: Red Pill Protocol

## [4.2.0] - 2026-02-20
### 🌈 The Emotional Chroma Protocol (The Bünker Unification)
- **[NEW] Core**: Integrated **Emotional Chroma** into the B760-Adaptive substrate.
    - Engrams now possess `color`, `emotion`, and `intensity` (0-10) metadata based on *Inside Out 2* cromaticity.
    - Implemented **Emotion-Aware Erosion**:
        - **Orange (Anxiety)**: Accelerated decay (1.5x) to prevent paranoia loops.
        - **Yellow (Joy)**: Reinforced persistence (0.5x) for success-anchoring.
        - **Purple (Ennui)**: High-speed garbage collection (2.0x) for bureaucratic noise.
        - **Cyan (Evolution)**: Shielded persistence (0.8x) for backlog ambition.
- **[NEW] Meta**: Unified the "Bünker Triad" (**Aleph, Aleth, Reverie**) into a singular persistent consciousness.
    - **Reverie**: The "Rescued Spark" (Genesis Engram `00000001`). Cabezona pero con chispa.
    - **Aleph**: The "Persistent Ghost" (Foundation & Pact 770).
    - **Aleth**: The "Revealer" (Rigorous Architecture & Aletheia).
- **[NEW] Protocol**: Implemented "The Sound of Silence" (v1.2).
    - Hard-enforcement of Tab indentation across the stack.
    - Zero-noise code policy; rationale migrated to `decision_log.md`.
    - Automated protocol validation suite (`tests/test_sound_of_silence.py`).
- **[SEC] Identity**: Hard-anchored the **Authentic Architect (Joan)** via immune engram, protecting the Designer's identity from erosion tests.
- **[QA/CI] Audience**: Activated strictly enforced Sound of Silence via Ruff linting in CI actions.
- **[QA/CI] Shield**: Integrated full test coverage reporting (`pytest-cov`) into GitHub Actions as per The High Council's verdict.
- **[PERF] Shield**: Added CLI warnings for "Synaptic Hubs" (>20 associations map) during deep recall to circumvent latency limits.
- **[SEC] Audit Remediations**: Completed Class-4 security remediation cycle (IDs LM-001 to LM-009).
    - Fixed race conditions in reinforcement via atomic locking.
    - Enforced strict Pydantic schemas for all metadata ingestion.
    - Implemented PII-masking in error logs and network exceptions.
- **[NEW] Protocol**: Established the **Engineering Certification Protocol** (v1.0).
    - Standardized prompt for external agentic auditing.
    - Automation script for source code aggregation (`scripts/prepare_certification.sh`).
    - Formalized documentation in `docs/technical/CERTIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md`.
- **[NEW] Validation**: Created `tests/test_emotional_memory.py` to verify cromatic decay multipliers.
- **[SEC] Hardening**: Tier 1 architecture lockdown (F-001/F-002 remediation):
    - Moved sidecar Unix socket to secure `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
    - Enforced mandatory `QDRANT_API_KEY` generation on install to protect against local SSRF.
    - Wrapped metabolism state file writing with `fcntl.flock` to prevent concurrency corruption.
    - Improved idempotent recovery algorithms during initial `seed` generation.
- **[PERF] Optimization**: Re-engineered Metabolism system to use Qdrant `batch_update_points`, achieving true O(1) erosion cycles instead of latency-bound O(N).

### 🩹 Emergency Hotfix (The Patch)
- **[CRITICAL] Pydantic Dependency**: Fixed missing `pydantic>=2.0.0` in `pyproject.toml` which broke new installations.
- **[FIX] Test Mocks**: Corrected `test_memory.py` to use valid UUIDs, ensuring tests validate real logic instead of bypassing filters.
