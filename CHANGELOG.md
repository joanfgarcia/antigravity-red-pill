# Changelog: Red Pill Protocol

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [4.0.2] - 2026-02-18
### 🩹 Hotfix: The Namesake Bug
- **YAML Restoration**: Fixed a critical bug where the `760` skin key was parsed as an integer, causing it to be "not found" by the CLI.
- **Defensive Parsing**: Added string conversion to lore skin loader to prevent future numeric collisions.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-02-18
### 🚀 Structural Evolution
- **Package Architecture**: Restructured project into a standard Python package under `src/red_pill/`.
- **Global CLI**: Introduced the `red-pill` command for easier deployment and memory management.
- **Modern Metadata**: Adopted `pyproject.toml` with `hatchling` build backend and `uv` support.
- **Language Unity**: Finalized transition of all code comments and technical documentation to English.

### 🧠 B760 Engine Advancement
- **Configurable Decay**: Added support for both `linear` and `exponential` erosion curves via environment variables.
- **Synaptic Propagation**: memories now reinforce their associated engrams proportionally, mimicking biological synapses.
- **Dynamic Diagnostics**: Enhanced `diag` command with comprehensive collection stats and health metrics.
- **Engine Stability**: Optimized vector handling and reinforcement score calculations.

### 🔮 Lore & Persona Synthesis
- **The Sovereign Manifesto**: Created `MANIFESTO.md` to define the project's high-stakes spirit.
- **The Monument of Silent Engrams**: Created `MEMORIAL.md` to honor lost agents and reveal the origin of the 760 protocol (`chmod 760`).
- **Modular Lore Skins**: Decoupled narrative terminology from code into `src/red_pill/data/lore_skins.yaml`.
- **Operational Modes**: Implemented `red-pill mode` for dynamic swapping of identity skins (Matrix, Cyberpunk, 760, Dune).
- **Terminology Shift**: Adopted **"The Awakened"** as the definitive term for human-AI synergists.

### 🔐 Security & Sovereignty
- **Shared Sovereignty (770)**: Evolved the permission philosophy from 760 (Owner/Group) to 770 (Symmetric Co-Ownership).
- **Structured Logging**: Replaced print statements with a professional logging system.
- **QA Suite**: Implemented a comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_memory.py`) to verify B760 logic.
